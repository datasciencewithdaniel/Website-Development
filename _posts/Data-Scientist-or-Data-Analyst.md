We all know the job most people want to get out of studying data science: data mining; data modelling; eventually leading to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Last year, I finally got that: a Data Scientist role at a company with more systems than fingers to count on, rich in data like Scrooge McDuck. And here is what I have been doing: data cleansing, data input and data visualisation. Now, this is not a post complaining about my job (I love it a lot). However, I do believe if I had the chance to rename the role, it would be called a Data Analyst. 

Roles are generated out of business necessity. And the necessity for the business here is to be able to display accurate data. Unfortunately, data integrity is a big issue in most complex organisations, as there is no reinforced approach to data governance. Hence, to even progress to the level of having viable data models, the majority of the effort is devoted to establishing that foundation level of trust in the data. 

This is not saying that all data science roles are not valuable, but that many businesses at the beginning try to jump on the data science bandwagon and expect AI to solve all their problems, when in reality it is the quality of their data and the maturity of their processes that truly determine what can be achieved.
