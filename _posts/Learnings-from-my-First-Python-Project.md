My first encounter with Python was in the subject called [Computational Thinking with Python](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=CITS1401). It was difficult to learn Python from a non-programming background and the projects we were required to do were challenging for me as a beginner. However, it was rewarding when I finished the project and got the output required. 

My approach for this project was first to write the pseudocode, or code in English that described what should happen, which helps to plan out my approach. I then created functions for all the different steps that I wanted to take. There were a lot of issues that came up here, as the edge cases caused these functions to not be as straightforward as I originally thought. In order to solve these issues, I think it is mostly helpful to write in small chunks of code, rather than write a whole function and try to figure out where it had gone wrong. In addition, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is one of the most helpful resources to answer questions that I had. 

The biggest learning that I had was to not get overwhelmed when starting. By breaking the project up into manageable steps and creating a function for each of these steps. This allowed me to work through the project piece by piece, writing the code that I knew, and then researching what I didn't know how to do. For anyone who is a beginner in Python, donâ€™t be scared, it will take a lot of trial and error in the beginning to get the output you want, but it will be a good learning experience, and with plenty of practice, you will become an expert in Python soon.
