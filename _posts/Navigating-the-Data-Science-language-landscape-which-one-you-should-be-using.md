Just like how we communicate to each other by speaking a language that both parties understand, the computer can only understand us if we talk to it in a language it understands. Similarly, like how many people can speak multiple languages, the computer can understand numerous languages. Programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, are used to tell the computer what data science tasks it needs to perform.

[Python](https://www.python.org) is now one of the most popular programming languages in Data Science. It is open source and enables users to perform various tasks, including data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualisation, machine learning, and many more. Python also has a number of libraries and packages, which simplifies the coding process and enables reproducibility of the userâ€™s code. Some popular libraries include numpy, pandas and scikit-learn.

Similarly, [R](https://www.r-project.org) is also open source and offers various libraries. It is more regarded as a statistical computing language, and it is powerful in finding statistical patterns and visualising data using a package called ggplot. R is a great tool to use in performing exploratory data analysis as well as statistical analysis such as linear regression, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, clustering and many more.

[SQL](https://www.mysql.com) is a database query language, which helps to extract insights quickly from data and makes it easier to manage and store data. A SQL database is a relational database, which organises data in a structured way so users can find and analyse the data they need quickly and makes data storage more robust. SQL is easy to learn compared to many other programming languages, as it has only a small number of commands to be used to talk to the computer. SQL is often used in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to move and manipulate large amounts of structured data.

Computers can understand other languages as well, such as JavaScript, C++, Bash and more. Many data scientists know more than one programming language, and it is essential to use the one that can perform the tasks required. Often a task can be done in multiple different ways, and you need to balance using a language that you know well, with one that may be more suited for the task.
