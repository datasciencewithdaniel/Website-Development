[The Age of A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8) is a documentary hosted by Robert Downey Jr., which showcases the development of Artificial Intelligence and how innovators are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It is an informative documentary presented in a fun and engaging way by 'Ironman', enabling audiences learn about where A.I. can change a human's life. 

The documentary covers 8 different topics, including building an artificial human, healing and replacing the human body, creating a life on Mars, and so on. Artificial Intelligence has been a hot topic in recent years and is sparking a range of new possibilities for humans, but what exactly can A.I. do and what more can it offer? There are several stories in each episode of the series, depicting how A.I. is being useful in many different fields and how all our lives could benefit from it. 

The first episode, ["How Far is Too Far?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8), introduces the lifelike simulation of a toddler, Baby X. The purpose of the simulation is to see whether a machine could be trained to have emotions and become human-like. Baby X is given a virtual brain, trained by  neural networks to simulate a human's brain, and learns like a human. The learning process for Baby X is through object recognition, for example, when Baby X is shown a spider, the image is formed in the virtual brain and the baby starts to remember the word and the image of a spider. Then the baby is taught that spider is scary and starts to cry, just like how a real baby cries when they are scared. This is a life changing simulation and shows how A.I. could interfere with our lives. 

It is truly amazing with how much Artificial Intelligence can do and working together with A.I. could really help our lives in many ways. If you want to check out what more Artificial Intelligence does, be sure to check out the [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8).
