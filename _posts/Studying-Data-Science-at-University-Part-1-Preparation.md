This series explores studying data science at University; the benefits, the challenges, and what to expect. Each post will look at a different aspect of the experience, and we are starting with Preparation.

Many students that I have met at University come from a similar background as I do, in that we have never studied computer science or programming before beginning our data science journey. This was not an issue, with the introductory units in Python and SQL assuming no knowledge of the language. Of course, having some experience gives you a head start at the beginning, but quickly all of the students were at the same level.

Data science studies is structured in a way that subsequent units build on each other, such as learning [Python](https://www.python.org/), and then using that knowledge to do machine learning. This means that you have to do more than just pass a test, you really need to put in time to learn the concepts, and be able to perform the work. Spending extra time on projects to write clean code and understand what is happening helps.

There is a lot of technical content in data science. You have your base of Python programming and statistics, but you also have other languages such as [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), and other areas such as cloud computing. To keep on top of this, I have found it beneficial to start reading textbooks and watching videos to prepare for the technical skills that you are going to learn in the following semester. An example of this is I am doing the web unit next, and therefore have spent part of my summer getting a crash course on the JavaScript and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) languages.

It is easy to get overwhelmed with all of the data science content. Taking it one step at a time, and really making sure that you understand before moving on, is important for your own understanding. Having good preparation and doing study beforehand gives you more time during the semester to slow down and get the most out of the course. If you do this, everything will fall into place and you will graduate as a Data Scientist in no time.
