In the second year of my Data Science course, I took the Cloud Computing [unit](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=CITS5503), and it changed a lot of my perspectives around what type of Data Scientist I wanted to be. Being exposed to the cloud showed me all of the usual possibilities, such as the virtual compute resources that can run my models faster, but also other services such as hosting a website to writing scripts that automate tasks. I know that these don't all fall under the typical Data Scientist job description, but the software engineering and DevOps opportunities really interested me.

My professor pointed out that the Cloud Computing unit pretty much lined up with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Solutions Architect [qualification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), which made sense as we were learning everything in AWS. Having a goal to not only complete the unit, but having the ability to walk away with an industry certification was a big motivation for ensuring that I learnt and understood the content, rather than just memorising facts for an exam.

This unit influenced the creation of Data Science with Daniel too. The skills I learnt made it possible to explore hosting a website on the cloud, and making the blog [cloud native](https://datasciencewithdaniel.com.au/posts/Building-DSWD-Part-2-Cloud-Native/). This project enabled me to build on skills that are required to work in the cloud, but maybe are skipped over in the general Data Science curriculum. Things such as networking, version control, security, and resource management were all important in getting the site up and running.

After completing the unit, I filled out the gaps in the Solution Architect curriculum before taking the test. This included revising all of the AWS services and what role they play in the cloud ecosystem. Having passed the exam and being able to call myself an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate is a great way for me to demonstrate that I have skills in working with the cloud, and I am going to graduate with more than just my Masters, but also something practical to take into my future roles and projects.
