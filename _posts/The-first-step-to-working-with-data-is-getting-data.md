Getting started with [Python](https://www.python.org) is pretty easy; learn how to write some functions and loops, import some libraries, and you are good to go. But that other big part of being a Data Scientist is working with data (who would have guessed?), and good data is a lot harder to find than good code. You would have heard of 'garbage in, garbage out' which is true, but often the situation is you don't know where the data is, or what data you need to get started.

With a defined problem, the role of a Data Scientist is to go out and find the data, or to identify what data is required and start collecting it. This is a tough challenge as public data could be anywhere on the web, and you have to know where to look. The first place that I like to look for data is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Kaggle is a site that contains a lot of public data that you can work with. I used Formula 1 data and COVID data for projects last year. It is also a platform for you to participate in Data Science challenges and competitions, and maybe earn some money if your solution is the best.

Another place that I like to look is at government data. In Australia, sites such as [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) for federal data or [data.wa.gov.au](https://data.wa.gov.au) for state data are also great places to look if you are after something that the government might collect. Now you won't find any personal details or confidential data here, but if you want to have some data on transport for example, government data is the place to look.

The hardest route is when there is no data and you have to go collect it yourself. Maybe setting up a sensor to get readings, or running some software to measure usage, is the way to get going. Starting from zero is difficult, but if you want to solve the problem, you are not going to get anywhere without the data. Now this isn't going to be the case when you want to get started with Data Science and practice your skills, but one day it might be what you are up against.

If you want to be a Data Scientist, then get used to looking for data. The easiest case is if you have already collected the data and it is this pristine dataset that is clean and ready for analysis. But that is utopia. Normally the situation is somewhere between that and nothing, but knowing how to get started and where to look go a long way to being productive and delivering results.
