Summer break is quite long in Australia, and it is a great time to get some practical experience, as people have always advised. Therefore, I tried my best to do as much as I could this summer, by completing  3 practical experiences, and it’s proven that what people have always advised is perfectly right. No matter how much I have studied, it is always good to work on a real project and to work with other people. Most importantly, it helped me to be more confident in my capacity. Most of the time, at university, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge I need to study with 4 units per semester and I did not realise how much I have learnt in such a short time.

For most of the summer, I worked on my internship with an AI [start-up company](https://www.winnowsolutions.com) working on sustainable food solution. I was very lucky to have this opportunity where I could work with a team of very experienced people in computer vision and machine learning. I was wondering a lot about how I could make some meaningful contribution to the team with such experienced people who know a lot more than me. Eventually, I realised that UWA has taught me a lot and other people in my team were very happy with my contribution. As I was working on a time series prediction problem, I had the chance to use all my statistics, [R](https://www.r-project.org), and [SQL](https://www.mysql.com) skills in combination with [Python](https://www.python.org) as the main one. This is a combination of skills that I have learnt through my [Master of Data Science](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/master-of-data-science) course at UWA.

Additionally, I also completed another project with [Practera](https://practera.com), which is an experiential learning experience for students. It’s a very short and compact experience, which lasts for just two weeks where students work in groups to solve a problem. I am assigned into a group with 6 other students from UWA with different backgrounds. We worked with the City of Joondalup Economic Council to analyse socio-economic information. We gathered the raw data from [EconomyID](https://economy.id.com.au) to create data visualisations of how different socio-economic indicators have changed over the past 20 years and compared these changes in different cities. This is a very basic skill which is not complicated at all, yet we managed to achieve really good results and made the information a lot more self-explainable and useful to the team. Almost all the information is available online, it is just how we used the skills we learnt to gather the data and utilise the information resource.

Finally, I had another project working on a Data Evaluation project through the [McCusker](https://mccuskercentre.uwa.edu.au/programs/internships) internship program. This is more like community work with a lot of community contribution factors attached to it. With this project, I am assigned to conduct literature review of statistical methods for evaluation of educational programs. It came by surprise to me how many evaluation reports significantly lack a solid statistical background and rely heavily on surveys and subjective opinions. As part of this project,  I developed a short simple statistical guide for people in my organisation to understand the basic statistical concepts and how to use them in their evaluation.

In the end, after the summer, I am very happy that I have chosen to study Master of Data Science. All the skills that I have learnt during this course are highly practical in almost any sector. Even if I have the chance to choose the course to do again, I would certainly still choose to study data science.
